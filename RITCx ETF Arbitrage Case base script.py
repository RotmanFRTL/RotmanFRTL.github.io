If you are not familiar with Python or feeling a little bit rusty, highly recommend you to go through the following link:

If you have any question about REST APIs and outputs of code please read:

The core of this case is to design algorithmic trading strategies that exploit arbitrage opportunities between the ETF (RITC) 
and its underlying stocks (BULL and BEAR), while effectively using tender offers and conversion tools to avoid speculative risk
and maximize returns.
